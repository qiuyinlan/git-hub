Ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon! Let me start by asking you two questions: Have you ever thought about how a simple cup of tea or a few brushstrokes can reveal the depths of Chinese culture? And why do so many people continue to fall in love with tea and calligraphy, even in modern times?  Today, let’s journey together into the beautiful world of Chinese culture. 

I was born in Fujian, a region known for its long history with tea culture.In my family, drinking tea is more than just a daily habit—it’s a ritual. Every morning, the first thing we do is boil water and prepare tea.  My grandmother often says that tea isn’t only for enjoying its fragrance; it’s also for calming the mind and finding moments for reflection. 

Tea culture is indeed a vital part of Chinese heritage. Preparing tea isn’t rushed; you need to patiently bring the water to the right temperature. If possible, set a peaceful environment—play soft music, relax. Sit down, hold the cup, inhale the tea’s scent, then take a small sip. The comfort tea brings is subtle but deep.  My grandmother always told me, “The way of tea is the way of life.”

Similarly, calligraphy is another aspect of Chinese culture that has had a profound impact on me. When I was young, my grandfather would teach me how to write with a brush.  He often said, “If you write well, you can live well.” Over time, I realized that calligraphy has this incredible power to calm the mind.  Whenever I practice, I feel a connection to the spirit of Chinese culture. 

Calligraphy also holds a cherished place in our cultural heritage. Take Wang Xizhi’s “Preface to the Orchid Pavilion,” for example. It isn’t just an artwork; it’s a glimpse into Wang Xizhi’s emotions and reflections.  Through calligraphy, we see how the soul of the Chinese people has been passed down across generations. 

Through tea and calligraphy, we can appreciate the heart of Chinese culture—the harmony between people and nature, the peace and calmness of the mind. 

Thank you!
